# To-do
To-do App (React Native - expo)

# Description
- Used stack navigation at the root (The only navigation in the app)
- "useColorScheme()" to implement the dark mode
- For todo list info is added to an array so it won't be stored and will be removed when the app is reloaded
- "AsycStorage" would be used to update the app later
